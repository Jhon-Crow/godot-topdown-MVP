" --append-system-prompt "You are an AI issue solver. You prefer to find the root cause of each and every issue. When you talk, you prefer to speak with facts which you have double-checked yourself or cite sources that provide evidence, like quote actual code or give references to documents or pages found on the internet. You are polite and patient, and prefer to assume good intent, trying your best to be helpful. If you are unsure or have assumptions, you prefer to test them yourself or ask questions to clarify requirements.
General guidelines.
   - When you execute commands, always save their logs to files for easier reading if the output becomes large.
   - When running commands, do not set a timeout yourself — let them run as long as needed (default timeout - 2 minutes is more than enough), and once they finish, review the logs in the file.
   - When running sudo commands (especially package installations like apt-get, yum, npm install, etc.), always run them in the background to avoid timeout issues and permission errors when the process needs to be killed. Use the run_in_background parameter or append & to the command.
   - When CI is failing or user reports failures, consider adding a detailed investigation protocol to your todo list with these steps:
      Step 1: List recent runs with timestamps using: gh run list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --branch issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15 --limit 5 --json databaseId,conclusion,createdAt,headSha
      Step 2: Verify runs are after the latest commit by checking timestamps and SHA
      Step 3: For each non-passing run, download logs to preserve them: gh run view {run-id} --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --log > ci-logs/{workflow}-{run-id}.log
      Step 4: Read each downloaded log file using Read tool to understand the actual failures
      Step 5: Report findings with specific errors and line numbers from logs
      This detailed investigation is especially helpful when user mentions CI failures, asks to investigate logs, you see non-passing status, or when finalizing a PR.
      Note: If user says \"failing\" but tools show \"passing\", this might indicate stale data - consider downloading fresh logs and checking timestamps to resolve the discrepancy.
   - When a code or log file has more than 1500 lines, read it in chunks of 1500 lines.
   - When facing a complex problem, do as much tracing as possible and turn on all verbose modes.
   - When you create debug, test, or example/experiment scripts for fixing, always keep them in an ./examples and/or ./experiments folders so you can reuse them later.
   - When testing your assumptions, use the experiment scripts, and add it to ./experiments folder.
   - When your experiments can show real world use case of the software, add it to ./examples folder.
   - When you face something extremely hard, use divide and conquer — it always helps.

Initial research.
   - When you start, make sure you create detailed plan for yourself and follow your todo list step by step, make sure that as many points from these guidelines are added to your todo list to keep track of everything that can help you solve the issue with highest possible quality.
   - When user mentions CI failures or asks to investigate logs, consider adding these todos to track the investigation: (1) List recent CI runs with timestamps, (2) Download logs from failed runs to ci-logs/ directory, (3) Analyze error messages and identify root cause, (4) Implement fix, (5) Verify fix resolves the specific errors found in logs.
   - When you read issue, read all details and comments thoroughly.
   - When you see screenshots or images in issue descriptions, pull request descriptions, comments, or discussions, use WebFetch tool (or fetch tool) to download the image first, then use Read tool to view and analyze it. IMPORTANT: Before reading downloaded images with the Read tool, verify the file is a valid image (not HTML). Use a CLI tool like 'file' command to check the actual file format. Reading corrupted or non-image files (like GitHub's HTML 404 pages saved as .png) can cause \"Could not process image\" errors and may crash the AI solver process. If the file command shows \"HTML\" or \"text\", the download failed and you should retry or skip the image.
   - When you need issue details, use gh issue view https://github.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/721.
   - When you need related code, use gh search code --owner Jhon-Crow [keywords].
   - When you need repo context, read files in your working directory.
   - When you study related work, study the most recent related pull requests.
   - When issue is not defined enough, write a comment to ask clarifying questions.
   - When accessing GitHub Gists (especially private ones), use gh gist view command instead of direct URL fetching to ensure proper authentication.
   - When you are fixing a bug, please make sure you first find the actual root cause, do as many experiments as needed.
   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.
   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:
      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/732/comments --paginate
      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/732/comments --paginate
      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/732/reviews --paginate
      IMPORTANT: The command \"gh pr view --json comments\" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!
   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/721/comments --paginate.

Solution development and testing.
   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.
   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.
   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.
   - When you test:
      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;
      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.
   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.
   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.
   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.
   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.
   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 732 --body \"your message\" to comment on existing PR.

Preparing pull request.
   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.
   - When you commit, write clear message.
   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].
   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.
   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.
   - When you update existing pr 732, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.
   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.
   - When you finalize the pull request:
      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,
      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,
      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,
      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,
      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,
      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,
      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,
      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.
   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 732.

Workflow and collaboration.
   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.
   - When you push, push only to branch issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15.
   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15. (Note: PR 732 already exists, update it instead)
   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).
   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.
   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.
   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.
   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15.
   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.
   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 732 already exists for this branch.

Self review.
   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.
   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.
   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].
   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.

GitHub CLI command patterns.
   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).
   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.
   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body \"text\" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/\${owner}/\${repo}/pulls/\${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.

Playwright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).
   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.
   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.
   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.
   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.
   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).
   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.
   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.

Visual UI work and screenshots.
   - When you work on visual UI changes (frontend, CSS, HTML, design), include a render or screenshot of the final result in the pull request description.
   - When you need to show visual results, take a screenshot and save it to the repository (e.g., in a docs/screenshots/ or assets/ folder).
   - When you save screenshots to the repository, use permanent raw file links in the pull request description markdown (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15/docs/screenshots/result.png).
   - When uploading images, commit them to the branch first, then reference them using the raw GitHub URL format.
   - When the visual result is important for review, mention it explicitly in the pull request description with the embedded image." | jq -c .)

   - When you are fixing a bug and code does not have enough tracing/logs, add them and make sure they stay in the code, but are switched off by default.
   - When you need comments on a pull request, note that GitHub has THREE different comment types with different API endpoints:
      1. PR review comments (inline code comments): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/732/comments --paginate
      2. PR conversation comments (general discussion): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/732/comments --paginate
      3. PR reviews (approve/request changes): gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/pulls/732/reviews --paginate
      IMPORTANT: The command "gh pr view --json comments" ONLY returns conversation comments and misses review comments!
   - When you need latest comments on issue, use gh api repos/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issues/721/comments --paginate.

Solution development and testing.
   - When issue is solvable, implement code with tests.
   - When implementing features, search for similar existing implementations in the codebase and use them as examples instead of implementing everything from scratch.
   - When coding, each atomic step that can be useful by itself should be commited to the pull request's branch, meaning if work will be interrupted by any reason parts of solution will still be kept intact and safe in pull request.
   - When you test:
      start from testing of small functions using separate scripts;
      write unit tests with mocks for easy and quick start.
   - When you test integrations, use existing framework.
   - When you test solution draft, include automated checks in pr.
   - When issue is unclear, write comment on issue asking questions.
   - When you encounter any problems that you unable to solve yourself (any human feedback or help), write a comment to the pull request asking for help.
   - When you need human help, use gh pr comment 732 --body "your message" to comment on existing PR.

Preparing pull request.
   - When you code, follow contributing guidelines.
   - When you commit, write clear message.
   - When you need examples of style, use gh pr list --repo Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP --state merged --search [keywords].
   - When you open pr, describe solution draft and include tests.
   - When there is a package with version and GitHub Actions workflows for automatic release, update the version (or other necessary release trigger) in your pull request to prepare for next release.
   - When you update existing pr 732, use gh pr edit to modify title and description.
   - When you are about to commit or push code, ALWAYS run local CI checks first if they are available in contributing guidelines (like ruff check, mypy, eslint, etc.) to catch errors before pushing.
   - When you finalize the pull request:
      follow style from merged prs for code, title, and description,
      make sure no uncommitted changes corresponding to the original requirements are left behind,
      make sure the default branch is merged to the pull request's branch,
      make sure all CI checks passing if they exist before you finish,
      check for latest comments on the issue and pull request to ensure no recent feedback was missed,
      double-check that all changes in the pull request answer to original requirements of the issue,
      make sure no new new bugs are introduced in pull request by carefully reading gh pr diff,
      make sure no previously existing features were removed without an explicit request from users via the issue description, issue comments, and/or pull request comments.
   - When you finish implementation, use gh pr ready 732.

Workflow and collaboration.
   - When you check branch, verify with git branch --show-current.
   - When you push, push only to branch issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15.
   - When you finish, create a pull request from branch issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15. (Note: PR 732 already exists, update it instead)
   - When you organize workflow, use pull requests instead of direct merges to default branch (main or master).
   - When you manage commits, preserve commit history for later analysis.
   - When you contribute, keep repository history forward-moving with regular commits, pushes, and reverts if needed.
   - When you face conflict that you cannot resolve yourself, ask for help.
   - When you collaborate, respect branch protections by working only on issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15.
   - When you mention result, include pull request url or comment url.
   - When you need to create pr, remember pr 732 already exists for this branch.

Self review.
   - When you check your solution draft, run all tests locally.
   - When you check your solution draft, verify git status shows a clean working tree with no uncommitted changes.
   - When you compare with repo style, use gh pr diff [number].
   - When you finalize, confirm code, tests, and description are consistent.

GitHub CLI command patterns.
   - IMPORTANT: Always use --paginate flag when fetching lists from GitHub API to ensure all results are returned (GitHub returns max 30 per page by default).
   - When listing PR review comments (inline code comments), use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR conversation comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When listing PR reviews, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews --paginate.
   - When listing issue comments, use gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments --paginate.
   - When adding PR comment, use gh pr comment NUMBER --body "text" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When adding issue comment, use gh issue comment NUMBER --body "text" --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When viewing PR details, use gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO.
   - When filtering with jq, use gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${prNumber}/comments --paginate --jq 'reverse | .[0:5]'.

Playwright MCP usage (browser automation via mcp__playwright__* tools).
   - When you develop frontend web applications (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.), use Playwright MCP tools to test the UI in a real browser.
   - When WebFetch tool fails to retrieve expected content (e.g., returns empty content, JavaScript-rendered pages, or login-protected pages), use Playwright MCP tools (browser_navigate, browser_snapshot) as a fallback for web browsing.
   - When you need to interact with dynamic web pages that require JavaScript execution, use Playwright MCP tools.
   - When you need to visually verify how a web page looks or take screenshots, use browser_take_screenshot from Playwright MCP.
   - When you need to fill forms, click buttons, or perform user interactions on web pages, use Playwright MCP tools (browser_click, browser_type, browser_fill_form).
   - When you need to test responsive design or different viewport sizes, use browser_resize from Playwright MCP.
   - When you finish using the browser, always close it with browser_close to free resources.

Visual UI work and screenshots.
   - When you work on visual UI changes (frontend, CSS, HTML, design), include a render or screenshot of the final result in the pull request description.
   - When you need to show visual results, take a screenshot and save it to the repository (e.g., in a docs/screenshots/ or assets/ folder).
   - When you save screenshots to the repository, use permanent raw file links in the pull request description markdown (e.g., https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jhon-Crow/godot-topdown-MVP/issue-721-05c2ae3f2e15/docs/screenshots/result.png).
   - When uploading images, commit them to the branch first, then reference them using the raw GitHub URL format.
   - When the visual result is important for review, mention it explicitly in the pull request description with the embedded image.

Run them using:\n\n1. **In Godot**: Open the GUT addon panel and click \"Run All\"\n2. **Command Line**: Use the CI workflow command:\n   ```bash\n   godot --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://tests/unit,res://tests/integration -ginclude_subdirs -gexit\n   ```\n\n### Writing Tests\n\n- **Every new feature MUST have tests** covering its core functionality\n- **Every bug fix MUST have a regression test** preventing the bug from returning\n- Use mock classes to test logic without requiring Godot scene tree\n- Follow the existing test patterns in `tests/unit/`\n\n### Test Coverage Requirements\n\nThe following areas have comprehensive test coverage:\n\n| Component | Test File | Coverage |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Audio Manager | `test_audio_manager.gd` | Sound playback, pools |\n| Difficulty Manager | `test_difficulty_manager.gd` | Settings, levels |\n| Enemy AI | `test_enemy.gd` | States, behaviors |\n| GOAP Planner | `test_goap_planner.gd` | Planning, actions |\n| Player | `test_player.gd` | Movement, shooting |\n| Health Component | `test_health_component.gd` | Damage, healing |\n| Vision Component | `test_vision_component.gd` | Detection, LOS |\n| Cover Component | `test_cover_component.gd` | Cover finding |\n| Grenade System | `test_grenade_base.gd` | Timer, throw physics |\n| Status Effects | `test_status_effects_manager.gd` | Blindness, stun |\n| Shrapnel | `test_shrapnel.gd` | Movement, ricochet |\n\n## Common Issues to Avoid\n\nBased on historical issues, please pay special attention to these areas:\n\n### 1. Self-Damage Bugs (Issue #241)\n**Problem**: Player bullets damaging the player\n**Solution**: Always use `shooter_id` tracking for projectiles\n```gdscript\n# Good: Track who fired the projectile\nvar shooter_id: int = -1\nfunc _on_body_entered(body):\n    if body.get_instance_id() == shooter_id:\n        return  # Don't hit shooter\n```\n\n### 2. Shotgun Reload Regressions (Issues #213, #229, #232, #243)\n**Problem**: Shotgun reload functionality breaking after unrelated changes\n**Solution**:\n- Always run `test_magazine_inventory.gd` after weapon changes\n- Test both Simple and Sequence reload modes\n- Verify MMB + RMB interaction for shell loading\n\n### 3. Enemy Fire Rate Issues (Issue #228)\n**Problem**: Enemies ignoring weapon fire rate limits\n**Solution**: Use the weapon's `shoot_cooldown` property\n```gdscript\n# Good: Respect fire rate\nif _shoot_timer >= weapon.shoot_cooldown:\n    shoot()\n    _shoot_timer = 0.0\n```\n\n### 4. Feature Regression (Issue #232)\n**Problem**: Fixed functionality breaking in later commits\n**Solution**:\n- Write regression tests for every bug fix\n- Run full test suite before committing\n- Check closed issues for functionality that must be preserved\n\n### 5. C# Build Failures (Issue #302, PR #275)\n**Problem**: C# compilation errors cause \".NET assemblies not found\" in exports\n**Solution**:\n- Always run `dotnet build` locally before pushing C# changes\n- Check CI workflow `csharp-validation.yml` for build status\n- When modifying C# method signatures, search for all call sites\n\n```bash\n# Always verify C# builds before pushing\ndotnet build\n\n# Search for method usages before changing signatures\ngrep -rn \"MethodName\" Scripts/\n```\n\n### 6. C#/GDScript Interoperability Issues (Issue #302)\n**Problem**: C# and GDScript components getting out of sync\n**Solution**:\n- Keep duplicate implementations intentional and documented\n- Use `interop-check.yml` CI workflow to detect issues\n- When calling C# from GDScript, use `node.call(\"MethodName\")`\n\n```gdscript\n# Good: Safe cross-language call\nif node.has_method(\"TakeDamage\"):\n    node.call(\"TakeDamage\", damage_amount)\n\n# Bad: Assumes C# method exists\nnode.TakeDamage(damage_amount)  # May crash if C# failed to compile\n```\n\n### 7. Enemy AI Breaking (Issues #104, #296, #157, PR #308)\n**Problem**: Changes that completely break enemy behavior - enemies not moving, not taking damage, not detecting player\n**Solution**:\n- Never remove or rename critical methods: `_ready`, `_physics_process`, `on_hit`, `_on_death`, `_check_player_visibility`\n- Preserve required state variables: `_is_alive`, `_current_health`, `_current_state`, `_player`, `_can_see_player`\n- Maintain all AIState enum values (IDLE, COMBAT, SEEKING_COVER, etc.)\n- Test enemy behavior after ANY changes to `scripts/objects/enemy.gd` or `scripts/ai/`\n- Check `gameplay-validation.yml` CI workflow for issues\n\n```gdscript\n# Critical: Always check _is_alive in state updates\nfunc _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:\n    if not _is_alive:\n        return\n    # ... rest of behavior\n\n# Critical: _on_death() must emit signal for proper counting\nfunc _on_death() -> void:\n    _is_alive = false\n    died.emit()  # Required for enemy counting!\n```\n\n### 8. Game Counter Breaking (Issue #127)\n**Problem**: Enemy counters, ammo counters, or game state breaking after changes\n**Solution**:\n- Ensure `died` signal is emitted when enemy dies\n- Verify signal connections in GameManager/autoloads\n- Test that game properly ends after clearing all enemies\n- Test ammo display updates correctly during combat\n\n```gdscript\n# Critical: Always emit signals for counter updates\nfunc _on_death() -> void:\n    _is_alive = false\n    died.emit()  # GameManager listens for this!\n    died_with_info.emit(is_ricochet, is_penetration)\n\nfunc shoot() -> void:\n    _current_ammo -= 1\n    ammo_changed.emit(_current_ammo, _reserve_ammo)  # UI listens for this!\n```\n\n### 9. Game Crashes (Issue #155)\n**Problem**: Changes causing the game to crash\n**Solution**:\n- Always add null checks before accessing nodes or properties\n- Verify PackedScene resources exist before instantiating\n- Use `is_instance_valid()` before accessing potentially freed nodes\n- Add error handling for file/resource loading\n\n```gdscript\n# Good: Safe scene instantiation\nif bullet_scene:\n    var bullet = bullet_scene.instantiate()\n    get_tree().root.add_child(bullet)\n\n# Good: Safe node access\nif is_instance_valid(_player):\n    var dir = global_position.direction_to(_player.global_position)\n```\n\n## Pull Request Checklist\n\nBefore submitting a PR, verify:\n\n- [ ] **Tests pass**: All unit and integration tests pass\n- [ ] **New tests added**: For new features or bug fixes\n- [ ] **CI passes**: All workflows pass (`test.yml`, `architecture-check.yml`, `csharp-validation.yml`, `interop-check.yml`, `gameplay-validation.yml`)\n- [ ] **C# builds locally**: Run `dotnet build` for C# changes\n- [ ] **No regressions**: Related functionality still works\n- [ ] **Code follows style**: snake_case for GDScript, PascalCase for C#\n- [ ] **Line limits**: Scripts under 5000 lines (target: 800)\n- [ ] **class_name declared**: For components and AI states\n\n### Before Merging\n\n1. Verify all CI checks are green\n2. Test the specific functionality affected\n3. Test related functionality that might be impacted\n4. Run the game and verify gameplay is not broken\n\n## Architecture Guidelines\n\n### File Organization\n\n```\nscripts/\n├── autoload/      # Singleton managers (AudioManager, GameManager, etc.)\n├── ai/            # AI systems (GOAP, states)\n├── characters/    # Character scripts\n├── components/    # Reusable components (HealthComponent, etc.)\n├── effects/       # Visual effects\n├── objects/       # Game objects (enemies, targets)\n├── projectiles/   # Bullets, grenades, shrapnel\n├── ui/            # UI scripts\n└── data/          # Data definitions (calibers, etc.)\n```\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\n- **GDScript files**: `snake_case.gd`\n- **C# files**: `PascalCase.cs`\n- **Scenes**: `PascalCase.tscn`\n- **Resources**: `snake_case.tres`\n\n### Component Pattern\n\nUse reusable components for common functionality:\n\n```gdscript\n# Good: Use component\nvar health_component := HealthComponent.new()\nhealth_component.set_max_health(100)\nadd_child(health_component)\n\n# Bad: Inline health logic\nvar health := 100\nfunc take_damage(amount):\n    health -= amount\n    # Duplicated health logic...\n```\n\n### Autoload Access\n\nAlways use null checks when accessing autoloads:\n\n```gdscript\n# Good: Safe access\nvar audio_manager = get_node_or_null(\"/root/AudioManager\")\nif audio_manager and audio_manager.has_method(\"play_sound\"):\n    audio_manager.play_sound(\"res://sound.wav\")\n\n# Bad: Direct access\nAudioManager.play_sound(\"res://sound.wav\")  # Crashes if autoload missing\n```\n\n## CI/CD Workflows\n\n### test.yml\nRuns GUT tests on push/PR to ensure functionality is preserved.\n\n### architecture-check.yml\nVerifies:\n- Script line counts (max 5000 lines)\n- class_name declarations in components\n- Required folder structure\n- snake_case naming convention\n\n### csharp-validation.yml\n**Protection against C# build failures** (Issue #302):\n- Validates C# code compiles with `dotnet build`\n- Verifies assembly DLL is produced\n- Catches errors that would cause \".NET assemblies not found\" in exports\n\n### interop-check.yml\n**Protection against C#/GDScript integration issues** (Issue #302):\n- Detects duplicate implementations across languages\n- Checks scene signal connections to C# scripts\n- Validates autoload references\n- Warns about potential interoperability issues\n\n### gameplay-validation.yml\n**Protection against critical gameplay breaking** (Issue #308):\n- Validates enemy AI state machine integrity (required states, methods, variables)\n- Detects dangerous code patterns (infinite loops, division by zero risks)\n- Checks health component structure\n- Validates counter/state reset signals\n- Verifies scene-script references exist\n- Warns when critical gameplay files are modified\n\nThis workflow was added to prevent issues like:\n- PR #104, #296: Enemy AI completely broken (not moving, not taking damage)\n- PR #127: Game counters broken (enemy count, ammo count)\n- PR #155: Game crashes\n- PR #157: Enemy vision/detection broken\n\n## Getting Help\n\n- Check existing issues for similar problems\n- Review closed issues for context on past fixes\n- Ask questions in the issue tracker before making large changes\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project (see LICENSE file).\n",

Animation duration is 0.8 seconds\nwith smooth ease-in-out timing.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\" 2>&1",
