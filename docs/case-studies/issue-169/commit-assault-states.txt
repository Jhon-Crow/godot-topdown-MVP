    Add PURSUING and ASSAULT states for improved enemy AI combat behavior
    
    Implements enhanced enemy combat AI with three major behavior changes:
    
    1. Combat Cover Cycling: In COMBAT state, enemies now come out of cover,
       shoot for 2-3 seconds (randomized), then return to cover. This creates
       more tactical and realistic combat encounters.
    
    2. Pursuit State (PURSUING): When enemies are far from the player and
       cannot hit them from their current position, they move cover-to-cover
       toward the player, waiting 2-3 seconds at each cover position.
    
    3. Assault State (ASSAULT): When 2+ enemies are in combat simultaneously,
       they coordinate an assault - taking the closest safe covers to the
       player, waiting 5 seconds, then rushing the player together while
       shooting.
    
    Also includes:
    - New GOAP actions (PursuePlayerAction, AssaultPlayerAction) for AI planning
    - Helper functions for distance/hit detection
    - Debug label updates showing timer info for ASSAULT and COMBAT states
    
    Fixes #88
